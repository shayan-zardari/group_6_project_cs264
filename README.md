Problem Statement: How can students organize their schedule through a web application in order to find time within their schedule to finish other tasks which do not fall with in other used time.

Workflow: 

Step 1: Sign in and enter fixed time schedules.

Step 2: Add tasks which need certain amount of time and due dates.

Step 3: Able to view daily/weekly/monthly schedule that shows time gaps.

Step 4: Assign tasks into the free time blocks.

Step 5: Mark tasks completed and update schedule as needed.

Step 6: Set reminders for edits or upcoming tasks.

MVP Scope:

Schedule Builder: Create/Edit fixed time blocks for daily and weekly view

Task List: add/edit/delete tasks with deadlines, and priorty queue
